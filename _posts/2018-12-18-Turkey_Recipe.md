Intro:
Cooking a turkey for the first time can be a daunting task, but once you do it you'll realize its surprisingly easy as the oven does most of the work, and it does provide a lot of meals for the amount of effort required. I've combined information from my own experience and multiple sites (mainly these two [Youtube][1] [videos][2] and this [Allrecipes page][3]) into the recipe below. My quick tip is plan ahead to defrost and check on your turkey every 30/1/1,5 hrs to make sure nothing goes wrong.



Ingredients/required items:

Non food items:
	- Dental floss/butcher's string (at least a foot)
	- Meat thermometer
	- 3 quart tray (or any tray that can fit a turkey, like the aluminum ones)
		○ Be careful this tray has some depth *insert almost burned house down story here*
			§ Try to make this a 'hover and show' effect

Veggies dont go crazy, minimal amounts (some optional)
Vegetables:
	-**not all of these are mandatory, not id highly recommend celery, carrots, and onions as these add to the flavour and absorb the juices from the turkey as it cooks. For all of these, do not cut these too thin (as they wont be able to absorb the juices well) or too thick (it'll be to hard to eat). **more description of how to cut it? Like carrot sticks, potato chuncks, celery just shop en go etc
	- Cut on some potatoes, cut into decent chuncks
	- Celery  (1 stall ish), cut into sticks
	- Carrots (1 ish), cut into sticks
	- Onion (half ish), chopped
		○ Half a small one, cut into 3 for the inside, optional
	- Mushroom (1/3 lb?), sliced or halved
	- Lemon slices (for the inside, optional), ~1/2 a lemon cut into 2 (2 slices)

Other stuff:
	- 1 cup butter
	- Thyme/rosemary/sage leaves (note: thyme and rosemary are strong, add little)
	- Optional: check broth , 1 cup
		○ Do not add this unless you have a deep dish.

And of course, the turkey.

**add checkmarks to this?

Now there are multiple recipes online that are very simple if you don’t have a stuffing, However, this type of stuffing is generally pretty cheap ($1 per box) and u'd need 2 boxes for a small turkey. Follow directions on it and put it aside.






Steps:
	- Defrost it.
		○ This will likely take overnight even if you just leave it outside. Obviously this isnt food safe but some people still do it. In the fridge (wrap, be wary of juices) or in runnign cold water is the safe way to do it.
		○ Usually a few days.
		○ Link time estimatE?
		○ Outside
		○ In fridge
		○ In running water
			§ Annotate it with 1st pt
	-
	- Cut up all veggies.
	- Cut off the uneeded stuff:
		○ Butt/tail
		○ Neck (usually detached already)
		○ Bag of innards
		○ Wish bone (optional, just makes carving a lot easier)
		○ You can add what you want to your dish, save this for gravy, or throw it out. Usually the bone gets thrown out, the rest for gravy. You can put the butt/tail and neck in, but don’t put the innards in in tray.

	- Wash it. Use water to rinse, pat dry. Seriously pat it dry. Then rub all around with salt (kosher's)
		○ Inside too
		○ Optional tbh unless u got time to put it back into a fridge

	- Make the inside mix and throw inside the chicken
	- Tie legs together
	- Hide the wing tips (tuck underneath bird or cut and put them there)
	- Melt butter for 60 sec... Just until edges turn brown. If you're using the circular tray it'll be about half of it or a quarter. This is a lot of butter. You can also mircowave it instead of frying til the edges are brown. Throw in some herbs. About 1 cup butter
		○ Add sage and rosemary
		○ Or honestly any herbs u have (I just threw in oregano and basil)
	- Brush outside with butter
		○ Pour it/spatula if u don’t have a brush. Obvs don’t use your hands (hot)
	- Then season salt and pep on top + around
	- Throw neck and butt in the sauce (optional)
	- Add chicken broth. 1 cup (optional)
	- Cook in oven. 325 F (to 350F) . Place on lowest rack (this is important so you don’t burn the top of your turkey and start a fire) . Check it after 90 mins
		○ 15 mins per lb APROX
		○ Middle of thigh: 170-180 degrees (not the bone)
		○ 13.5 lb is about 3.5-4 hrs
			§ Check 1.5 hrs in
	- For carving tips look at utube video

Fun facts: I eat a lot per meal. So this'll probably be higher for you. Still:
$12 turkey lasted 14 meals. (~13lb)
= 11.50/0.78=14.7436 lb (more like 15 lb)
$10 turkey lasted ~8 meals
	4.4*2.2=9.68 (so yeah 10 lb)


Some details/revisions:
	- Do NOT put broth in. Holy. Almost set the house on fire
		○ If you want to be sure to use a LARGE DEEP thing to hold the turkey.
	- Try adding containers /al foil to hold drips. Or al foil.
	- Celery/carrots/onion are placed on the bottom of the tray. Not int he bird
	- You also need 2 boxes of the turkey mix. Follow instructions on those to prep
	- If you want to try stuffing the turkey skin underneath with butter dont melt it obvs
